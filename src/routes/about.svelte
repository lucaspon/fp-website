        <h1 class="mb-3">What is Fingerprints?</h1>
        <p class="mb-10">
          Fingerprints is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) established in the Ethereum
          mainnet with the purpose of pioneering ways to curate, collect and further blockchain art.<br
          /><br />
        </p>
        <h1 class="mb-3">What are $PRINTS tokens?</h1>
        <p class="mb-10">
          $PRINTS is our governance token through which enthusiasts, collectors and artists can
          become members.<br /><br />
          It also works as a means to gain exposure to our collection and wield voting power within the
          organization.
        </p>

        <h1 class="mb-3">What are the perks of Fingerprints membership?</h1>
        <p class="mb-10">
          Fingerprints members gain exclusive access to our private discord channels, where they can
          mingle with our collected artists and other cool members.<br /><br />
          <br />
          You also become eligible to work for the DAO and earn ETH and special roles within the community
          (<a href="#" class="text-rawblue">learn more</a>).<br /><br />
          Members will also gain priority access in future drops, events and projects premiered by RAW.<br
          /><br />
          We're constantly working to expand the perks of Fingerprints membership, so there's a lot more
          we can't anticipate!
        </p>

        <h1 class="mb-3">How does Fingerprints' curation system work?</h1>
        <p class="mb-5">[TBD]</p>

        <h1 class="mb-3">How do I become a member?</h1>
