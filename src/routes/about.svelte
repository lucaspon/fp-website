        <h1 class="mb-3">What is RAW?</h1>
        <p class="mb-10">
          RAW is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) established in the Ethereum mainnet
          with the purpose of pioneering ways to curate, collect and further NFT photography.<br
          /><br />
          It launched as an incubation from
          <a href="https://www.fingerprintsdao.xyz/" class="text-rawblue">Fingerprints DAO</a>, and
          has since developed its own community.
        </p>
        <h1 class="mb-3">What are $RAW tokens?</h1>
        <p class="mb-10">
          $RAW is our governance token through which enthusiasts, collectors and artists can become
          members.<br /><br />
          It also works as a means to gain exposure to our collection and wield voting power within the
          organization.
        </p>

        <h1 class="mb-3">What are the perks of RAW membership?</h1>
        <p class="mb-10">
          RAW members gain exclusive access to our private discord channels, where they can mingle
          with our collected artists and other cool members.<br /><br />
          Members can participate in the decentralized curation system, nominating collections and voting
          on which ones they believe RAW should acquire.
          <br /><br />
          You also become eligible to work for the DAO and earn ETH and special roles within the community
          (<a
            href="https://snapshot.org/#/rawdao.eth/proposal/0x12e284f4598f60cf37667c9a69b8930d12ac5f88b45b95c66b2537ec540de628"
            class="text-rawblue">learn more</a
          >).<br /><br />
          Members will also gain priority access in future drops, events and projects premiered by RAW.<br
          /><br />
          We're constantly working to expand the perks of RAW membership, so there's a lot more we can't
          anticipate!
        </p>

        <h1 class="mb-3">How does RAW's curation system work?</h1>
        <p class="mb-5">
          Every month there is a decentralized curation cycle in RAW that follows the following
          steps:
        </p>

        <table class="table-auto border border-gray-300 border-separate mb-10">
          <thead class="border border-gray-400">
            <tr class="border border-gray-400">
              <th class="border border-gray-400">Week</th>
              <th class="border border-gray-400">Activity</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody class="border border-gray-400">
            <tr class="border border-gray-400">

              <td class="p-2 border border-gray-400"
                >Nomination week: members submit collection suggestions for the curation cycle, of
                which the first 20 are chosen.</td

            </tr>
            <tr class="border border-gray-400">
              <td class="p-2 border border-gray-400">Weeks 2 & 3</td>
              <td class="p-2 border border-gray-400"
                >Voting weeks: members gather to discuss and vote on which of the nominated collections they believe
                RAW should acquire using an approval voting system.<br /><br />
                The top 3 voted collections will be acquired by RAW.</td
              >
            </tr>
            <tr class="border border-gray-400">
              <td class="p-2 border border-gray-400">Week 4</td>
              <td class="p-2 border border-gray-400"
